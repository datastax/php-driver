RetryPolicy\DefaultPolicy:
  comment: |-
    The default retry policy. This policy retries a query, using the
    request's original consistency level, in the following cases:

    * On a read timeout, if enough replicas replied but the data was not received.
    * On a write timeout, if a timeout occurs while writing a distributed batch log.
    * On unavailable, it will move to the next host.

    In all other cases the error will be returned.
