TimestampGenerator\Monotonic:
  comment: |-
    A timestamp generator that generates monotonically increasing timestamps
    client-side. The timestamps generated have a microsecond granularity with
    the sub-millisecond part generated using a counter. The implementation
    guarantees that no more than 1000 timestamps will be generated for a given
    clock tick even if shared by multiple session objects. If that rate is
    exceeded then a warning is logged and timestamps stop incrementing until
    the next clock tick.
