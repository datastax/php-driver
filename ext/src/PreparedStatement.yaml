PreparedStatement:
  comment: |-
    Prepared statements are faster to execute because the server doesn't need
    to process a statement's CQL during the execution.

    With token-awareness enabled in the driver, prepared statements are even
    faster, because they are sent directly to replica nodes and avoid the extra
    network hop.
