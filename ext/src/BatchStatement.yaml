BatchStatement:
  comment: |-
    Batch statements are used to execute a series of simple or prepared
    statements.

    There are 3 types of batch statements:
     * `Cassandra::BATCH_LOGGED`   - this is the default batch type. This batch
       guarantees that either all or none of its statements will be executed.
       This behavior is achieved by writing a batch log on the coordinator,
       which slows down the execution somewhat.
     * `Cassandra::BATCH_UNLOGGED` - this batch will not be verified when
       executed, which makes it faster than a `LOGGED` batch, but means that
       some of its statements might fail, while others - succeed.
     * `Cassandra::BATCH_COUNTER`  - this batch is used for counter updates,
       which are, unlike other writes, not idempotent.
